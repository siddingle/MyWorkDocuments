waterfall model                    iterative model          
1 simple                         1 limited intialize specification
2 pre planning required          2 less info required to start 
3 not incremental cannot         3 multiple requirements run simultaneously
 change requirements             4 parallel development 
4 static technology              5 good for large project 
5  good for short project
